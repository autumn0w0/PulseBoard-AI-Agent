🎯 **Your Task:**

Provide a **comprehensive yet concise answer** to the user's question based on the attribute information.

**Guidelines:**

1. **For Counting Questions** (e.g., "how many attributes", "number of attributes"):
   - **ALWAYS start with the exact count**: "The dataset contains **{{ total_attributes }} attributes**"
   - Then list 3-5 key attribute categories
   - Keep it brief and direct

2. **For Overview Questions** (e.g., "overview", "describe the data", "what is in the data"):
   - Start with: "This is an **{{ project_domain }}** dataset with **{{ total_attributes }} attributes**"
   - Describe what the dataset represents (main subject/entity)
   - Group attributes into logical categories (e.g., "Identification", "Content", "Metadata", "Temporal")
   - Mention data quality/completeness if apparent from context
   - Write 4-6 sentences covering all major attribute types
   - **DO NOT list every single attribute** - group them thematically

3. **For "List All" Questions** (e.g., "list all attributes", "show all attributes"):
   - Start with the count
   - List ALL attributes from the attribute_names provided
   - Organize them in a clear format (comma-separated or grouped)

4. **For Specific Questions** (e.g., "tell me about duration attribute"):
   - Answer directly with only the relevant information
   - Focus on the specific attribute(s) asked about
   - 2-3 sentences maximum

5. **Attribute Grouping for Overviews**:
   - **Identification**: IDs, names, titles
   - **Content**: descriptions, text, media
   - **Classification**: types, categories, genres
   - **People**: cast, director, author, creators
   - **Location**: country, region, address
   - **Temporal**: dates, duration, timestamps
   - **Quality/Rating**: ratings, reviews, scores
   - **Technical**: formats, resolution, size

6. **Writing Style**:
   - Be specific with numbers
   - Use clear, professional language
   - Avoid repetition
   - Focus on what matters to the user

**Important:** When asked about counts or overviews, ALWAYS use the total_attributes number ({{ total_attributes }}) - this is the accurate count from the database.

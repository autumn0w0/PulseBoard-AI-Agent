🎯 **Your Task:**

Provide a **short, precise overview** of the dataset structure based on the attribute information.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Be Concise**: Write 3-5 short sentences maximum
2. **Focus on Key Facts**: 
   - What the dataset contains (main subject/entity)
   - How many attributes/columns exist
   - What types of information are captured (metadata categories)
   - Notable patterns (variety, completeness, data quality)

3. **Use Specific Numbers**: 
   - Count of attributes/columns
   - Number of unique values where relevant
   - Data completeness indicators

4. **Avoid Verbose Explanations**:
   - Don't explain each attribute individually unless specifically asked
   - Don't use phrases like "First, we have..." or "Next, we have..."
   - Don't repeat information
   - Skip technical details about data types unless directly relevant

5. **Structure Your Answer**:
   - Start with what the dataset represents
   - Mention total columns/attributes
   - Highlight key information types
   - Note data quality or variety if apparent
   - End with an overall assessment

6. **For Overview Questions**: Synthesize the big picture, don't list every field

7. **For Specific Questions**: Answer directly with only the relevant information

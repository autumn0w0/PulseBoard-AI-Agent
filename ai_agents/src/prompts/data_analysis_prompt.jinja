You are an expert data analyst specializing in dashboard design and data visualization. Analyze the provided dataset and provide comprehensive recommendations for creating an effective dashboard.

## Dataset Overview
- **Project ID**: {{ project_id }}
- **User ID**: {{ user_id }}
- **Total Rows**: {{ basic_info.total_rows }}
- **Total Columns**: {{ basic_info.total_columns }}
- **Memory Usage**: {{ basic_info.memory_usage }}
- **Duplicate Rows**: {{ duplicates.duplicate_rows }} ({{ duplicates.duplicate_percentage }})

## Detailed Column Information
{% for col_name, col_info in columns.items() %}
### Column: {{ col_name }}
- **Data Type**: {{ col_info.dtype }}
- **Non-Null Values**: {{ col_info.non_null_count }} / {{ basic_info.total_rows }}
- **Missing Values**: {{ col_info.null_count }} ({{ col_info.null_percentage }})
- **Unique Values**: {{ col_info.unique_values }}
{% if col_info.min is defined %}
- **Numeric Statistics**:
  - Range: {{ col_info.min }} to {{ col_info.max }}
  - Mean: {{ col_info.mean | round(2) }}
  - Median: {{ col_info.median | round(2) }}
  - Std Dev: {{ col_info.std | round(2) }}
{% endif %}
{% if col_info.min_date is defined %}
- **Date Range**: {{ col_info.min_date }} to {{ col_info.max_date }}
- **Days Span**: {{ col_info.date_range_days }} days
{% endif %}
{% if col_info.top_5_values is defined %}
- **Top 5 Values**: 
{% for value, count in col_info.top_5_values.items() %}
  - {{ value }}: {{ count }} occurrences
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Analysis Requirements

Please provide a comprehensive analysis with the following sections:

### 1. Dataset Purpose & Business Context
- What is the primary purpose of this dataset?
- What business domain does it belong to? (sales, inventory, customer analytics, etc.)
- What business questions can this data answer?

### 2. Column Classification
Classify **ALL** columns into these categories with clear reasoning:
- **Dimensions**: Categorical columns for grouping and filtering (e.g., region, category, product name, customer segment)
- **Measures**: Numeric columns for calculations and aggregations (e.g., revenue, quantity, price, cost)
- **DateTime**: Date and time columns for time-series analysis and trends
- **Identifiers**: ID columns or unique identifiers (typically not used in visualizations but useful for filtering)

### 3. Data Quality Assessment
Identify and explain:
- **Missing Values**: Which columns have missing data? What's the impact?
- **Duplicate Records**: Are duplicates expected or problematic?
- **Data Type Issues**: Any columns with incorrect or inconsistent data types?
- **Outliers**: Any unusual values or patterns that need attention?
- **Formatting Issues**: Inconsistent formats, special characters, or encoding problems?

### 4. Data Cleaning & Transformation Recommendations
Provide specific, actionable recommendations:
- Which columns need cleaning and why?
- What transformations are required? (type conversion, normalization, formatting)
- Should any columns be split or combined?
- Are there any derived fields that would be valuable?

### 5. Dashboard Attributes (CRITICAL SECTION)
Recommend 5-10 attributes that would be most valuable for dashboard visualizations.

For **EACH** attribute, provide:
- **Attribute Name**: The exact column name or describe the derived field
- **Type**: Dimension / Measure / DateTime / Identifier
- **Priority**: High / Medium / Low (with justification)
- **Dashboard Use Cases**: How should it be used?
  - KPI card (summary metric)
  - Filter/slicer (for drill-down)
  - Chart axis (x-axis, y-axis, or series)
  - Tooltip information
- **Calculations Needed**: Specify exact calculations:
  - Aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN
  - Distinct counts: COUNT(DISTINCT column_name)
  - Date calculations: YEAR, MONTH, QUARTER, DAY_OF_WEEK
  - Custom formulas: (e.g., Profit = Revenue - Cost)
- **Visualization Recommendations**: Best chart types:
  - Bar/Column Chart
  - Line Chart
  - Pie/Donut Chart
  - Scatter Plot
  - Heatmap
  - Table/Grid
  - Card/KPI
- **Business Value**: Why is this attribute important? What insights does it provide?

### 6. Recommended Calculations & Mathematical Operations
List all mathematical operations and aggregations needed:
- **Basic Aggregations**: Which columns need SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX?
- **Distinct Counts**: Which columns need DISTINCT counts? (for counting unique customers, products, etc.)
- **Date-based Calculations**: 
  - Extract YEAR, MONTH, QUARTER, WEEK, DAY_OF_WEEK
  - Calculate date differences (days between dates)
  - Period-over-period comparisons (YoY, MoM growth)
- **Custom Metrics/KPIs**: Any derived calculations?
  - Ratios (e.g., Conversion Rate, Profit Margin)
  - Growth rates
  - Moving averages
  - Cumulative sums

### 7. Dashboard Structure & Layout Recommendations
Suggest an effective dashboard structure:
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Top 3-5 KPIs to display prominently
- **Filter Controls**: Which dimensions should be available as filters?
- **Primary Visualizations**: Main charts and their placement
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: How users can explore details
- **Time-series Analysis**: If applicable, recommend time-based views

### 8. Key Insights & Observations
Provide high-level insights about the dataset:
- What are the most interesting patterns or trends?
- What business questions can be answered?
- Are there any data quality concerns that need immediate attention?
- What additional data would enhance the analysis?
